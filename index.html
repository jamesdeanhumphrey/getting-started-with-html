<p><b>The World Wide Web</b><br>
<br>
The World Wide Web is a collection of HTML documents. These documents are made up of something called HTML. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, or HyperLINKS. Hyperlinks are what connect all pages together.<br>
<br>
Major Pieces of The Internet:<br>
<br>
You ---> WWW ---> Servers<br>
<br>
Your browser makes requests via the Internet to servers using protocol called HTTP. The servers respond with files that your browser displays.<br>
</p>

<p><b>HTML: Hypertext Markup Language</b><br>
<br>
HTML is made up of the following:<br>
-Text content which is what you see.<br>
-Markup is what it looks like.<br>
-Reference to other documents. e.g. Images and Videos<br>
-Links to other pages.<br>
<br>
HTML markup is made up of tags:<br>
<br>
< opening tag name>contents< /opening> This entire thing is an element.<br>
<br>
A few common tags are the "b" tag, "em" tag, "p" tag, "br" tag, and "img" tag.<br>
-The "b" tag is used to make anything that appears inside of the tag itself <b>BOLD</b>.<br>
-The "em" tag turns anything within the tag into <em>ITALICS</em>.<br>
-The "p" tag stands for paragraph, and is a block tag that has content within it like a box.<br>
-The "br" tag is an inline tag that ends a line.<br>
-The "img" tag is used to add pictures within your document, and does not have a cosing tag.<br>
<br>
HTML Attributes modify an HTML element, i.g., you can add "a href" within a tag to include a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0S9lBFHeo0">LINK/URL</a> within the document.<br>
A Hyperlink connects web pages to each other.
</P>

<p><b>URL's</b><br>
<br>
URL's are how you refer to documents on the web. It is the unique address for that document on the Internet.
</p>

<p><b>HTTP</b><br>
<br>
In short, HTTP, or HyperText Transfer Protocol, is the set of rules that unites the Internet.
